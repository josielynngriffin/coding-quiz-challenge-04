# Coding Quiz Challenge-04

## Description
For this project, I was tasked with creating a timed multiple-choice coding quiz. I built it from scratch with a basic outline of HTML as well as dynamically generated HTML elements, and styled it all to have a clean and responsive layout. My CSS is not as DRY as I would like it to be, but I tried to prioritize working the quiz's function out in JavaScript with the limited time I had outside of class for this project.

With that said, my motivations were to really try to wrap my head around planning an application and it's functions out and then make it come alive with JavaScript interaction. By breaking the overall application's functionality down into pieces (starting the game, iterating over the questions, the timer, etc), I was able to create a project that worked as a whole. 

This project helped me to better understand setInterval timers, localStorage, and using JavaScript to dynamically generate elements. I feel much more confident building functions to complete tasks than I did before this assignment, so even though I think this code could certainly be improved on, I feel happy with what I was able to do for this challenge.
